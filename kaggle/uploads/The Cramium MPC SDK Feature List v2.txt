The Cramium MPC SDK Feature List v2 (Version 0.8) is a detailed technical and functional specification sheet for a mobile-centric, secure multi-party computation (MPC) cryptographic SDK developed by CrossBar, Inc. This SDK is designed to provide cryptographic key management and secure wallet operations across multiple platforms. Below is a professional, scientific, and business-oriented breakdown of its key components and their implications:

üîê 1. Authentication
The SDK supports advanced and flexible authentication mechanisms, essential for secure identity verification in decentralized finance (DeFi), wallet apps, and digital ID platforms:

Mobile Passkey (FIDO2): Passkey-based passwordless authentication using FIDO2 improves usability and phishing resistance.

API Key: Traditional token-based access, useful for backend integrations.

Social 2FAs: Adds second-factor authentication using social logins or apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy), enhancing user security.

Business Insight: Supporting modern and legacy authentication mechanisms makes this SDK suitable for enterprises aiming for a broader user demographic and smooth UX onboarding.

üîê 2. MPC Modes
Cramium SDK supports two distinct MPC (Multi-Party Computation) cryptographic key handling modes:

Full MPC: Entire key material is never reconstructed in one place‚Äîideal for maximum security.

Mnemonic-compatible MPC: Allows compatibility with seed phrases (mnemonics), offering smoother user migration from legacy wallets.

Technical Insight: This dual-mode design balances between high security (Full MPC) and interoperability with traditional wallets (Mnemonic-compatible MPC).

‚öôÔ∏è 3. MPC Configuration Schemes
Support for flexible threshold cryptographic setups allows various quorum models for secure signing:

2-of-2 (Mobile and Cloud)

2-of-3 (Mobile, Cloud, Browser)

2-of-3 (2 Mobiles, Cloud)

T-of-N across multiple devices including hardware wallets

Business Insight: These configurations enable adaptable security policies for personal users, teams, or institutions needing shared custody or redundancy.

‚õìÔ∏è 4. Blockchain Compatibility
Supports 30+ major blockchains, targeting 50+ by year-end. Already includes:

Major L1s and L2s: Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Tron, XRP

DeFi-focused chains: Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, BSC

New and emerging chains: Ton

Strategic Insight: Broad chain support makes the SDK attractive for multi-chain wallet apps, DeFi aggregators, and custodial service providers.

üíæ 5. Backup and Recovery
Cloud Backup: Full key-share backup to user-specific cloud (iCloud for iOS, Google Cloud for Android)

Risk Mitigation: Ensures non-custodial user experience with recoverability, vital for user retention and trust.

üß© 6. SDK Availability
Cross-platform developer libraries indicate high portability and developer adoption potential:

iOS (Swift)

Android (Kotlin)

Flutter (Cross-platform)

Browser Extension (JavaScript/TypeScript)

Developer Enablement: Enables rapid deployment of secure wallet features across native and hybrid apps, enhancing time-to-market.

üî¨ 7. MPC Cryptographic Libraries
Utilizes cutting-edge threshold signature schemes:

ECDSA:

GG18/GG20: Secure, standard protocols for threshold signing

DKLs23: More recent efficient threshold schemes

EdDSA:

FROST: State-of-the-art threshold signing algorithm for Ed25519

Technical Depth: Demonstrates use of advanced cryptography research, positioning Cramium as a next-gen MPC solution.

‚òÅÔ∏è 8. Infrastructure
Global Google Cloud backend ensures scalability, reliability, and compliance.

iCloud integration for Apple ecosystem

Enterprise-Grade Hosting: Ideal for fintech partners or regulated institutions with global user bases.

üëõ 9. Crypto Wallet Functionalities
Includes comprehensive wallet features for modern crypto apps:

HD Key Derivation: BIP32-style tree structures for deterministic wallets

Single-key Wallet Import/Export (for mnemonic mode): Migration path from non-MPC wallets

DeFi Integrations (Swaps): Supports real DeFi use-cases

Dapp Compatibility (WalletConnect): Seamless web3 app interactions

Multi-wallet Support: Ideal for users managing several assets/accounts

Key Rotation and Reshare: Essential for key lifecycle management and compliance

Transaction Policy: Fine-grained control over what transactions are allowed

Operational Advantage: These features make the SDK not just secure but also practically usable in mainstream DeFi and custodial contexts.

üîó 10. Cloud Services
Google Cloud for Android

iCloud for iOS

Cross-OS Support: Emphasizes native cloud integration for a smoother user experience and higher app retention.

üìà Business Use Cases
Consumer Wallets: Secure, recoverable wallets with seamless Dapp access.

Institutional Custody: Multi-party signing and policy enforcement ideal for compliance.

DeFi Platforms: SDK features align well with DeFi transaction workflows and asset interoperability.

Web3 Applications: Browser and mobile SDKs support seamless integration with decentralized apps.
