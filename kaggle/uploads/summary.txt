Comprehensive Executive Summary and Deep Analysis: Cramium MPC SDK, PHSM Hardware, and the Daric Secure MCU

The Cramium ecosystem, developed by CrossBar, Inc., is a vertically integrated and security-centric platform for decentralized digital asset custody. It comprises the Cramium MPC SDK, the PHSM (Portable Hardware Secure Module) hardware wallet, and the custom-designed Daric Secure MCU. These components collectively address the critical need for verifiable security, modular cryptographic infrastructure, and user-resilient wallet design. With a foundation in open-source principles and hardware-rooted trust, Cramium presents a complete, future-proof solution for both institutional and consumer Web3 applications.

Multi-Party Computation (MPC): Architecture, Modes, and Configurations
At the core of the Cramium architecture is its dual-mode MPC framework. The first mode, Full MPC, ensures that private keys are never reconstructed—not during generation, storage, or transaction signing. This is achieved using Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and threshold signature schemes, making it ideal for institutions with high security requirements. The second mode, Mnemonic-Compatible MPC, innovatively addresses backward compatibility by using a one-time Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme to split mnemonic-derived private keys. Subsequent operations are executed using MPC, combining BIP32/39 compatibility with ongoing cryptographic security.

Cramium supports flexible MPC configurations to accommodate diverse operational models. These include 2-of-2 setups (e.g., mobile and cloud), 2-of-3 (such as mobile, cloud, and browser), and more generalized T-of-N schemes, which can integrate hardware wallets, multiple mobile devices, and browser-based clients. This enables customizable governance models, whether for individual users, multi-sig institutional setups, or fully self-custodial deployments.

Cryptographic Protocols and Optimizations
The SDK supports multiple MPC protocols, enabling developers to optimize for performance and security based on deployment context. For ECDSA—which remains the dominant signature scheme across most blockchains—Cramium implements modified GG18/20 and DKLs23. The former emphasizes low communication overhead suitable for modern mobile environments, while the latter provides lightweight computation ideal for browser or bandwidth-limited settings. For newer cryptographic curves such as EdDSA and Schnorr, Cramium leverages FROST, a linear signature scheme that scales efficiently in t-of-n scenarios.

To further improve performance, the SDK integrates a proprietary Packed Secret Sharing (PSS) technique that eliminates redundant nonce exchange, reducing signing latency by over 50% in certain scenarios. The roadmap includes dynamic runtime selection of MPC protocols based on device performance and network conditions, enabling adaptive optimization without developer intervention.

Blockchain and Ecosystem Compatibility
Cramium currently supports more than 30 leading blockchains, with plans to exceed 50 by the end of 2025. Existing support includes major L1 chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Tron, as well as L2 and DeFi-centric chains such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, BSC, and Polygon. The upcoming roadmap adds support for chains like Cardano, Avalanche, Cosmos, Hedera, Dogecoin, and Stellar, further enhancing multi-chain flexibility for wallet and application developers.

To address evolving standards in Ethereum, Cramium includes support for EIP-7702, which allows EOAs to temporarily delegate authority to smart contracts. The SDK mitigates associated risks by enforcing address whitelisting across MPC participants and ensuring signatures for both authorization and transaction payloads are generated via MPC. This dual-layer validation helps prevent unauthorized delegation and strengthens operational controls.

Infrastructure and Recovery
Cramium’s backend infrastructure runs on Google Cloud, offering global scalability, resilience, and compliance. For encrypted backup and recovery, the SDK supports native integrations with Google Drive (for Android) and iCloud (for iOS). This ensures non-custodial wallet models can still deliver user-friendly recovery options, reducing friction without compromising key control. The infrastructure design supports both retail-scale deployments and enterprise rollouts that demand high uptime, geo-distribution, and regulatory alignment.

Wallet Functionalities and Transaction Policies
The SDK delivers a robust wallet feature set critical for modern digital asset management. It supports BIP32-compliant HD key derivation, multi-wallet account handling, and dApp interoperability via WalletConnect. Mnemonic-compatible users benefit from seamless import/export capabilities, enabling migration from single-key legacy wallets. Additional capabilities include DeFi swap integration, key rotation, and resharing—vital for secure lifecycle management and custodial transitions.

Cramium also introduces advanced transaction policy enforcement. Users or institutions can implement address whitelisting with customizable activation delays (24–72 hours), and define per-transaction or daily spending limits denominated in USD. These policies add a layer of proactive security, enabling risk control at the cryptographic level and enhancing compliance for regulated platforms.

PHSM: The World’s First Hardware Wallet with Native MPC
The PHSM (Portable Hardware Secure Module) is the industry’s first hardware wallet to support native MPC computation. It is fully compatible with t-of-n MPC topologies and can operate as a co-signing device in multi-party configurations. The PHSM is FIDO2-certified, enabling passkey-based authentication and WebAuthn support for both Web2 and Web3 use cases.

The device offers user interface enhancements uncommon in traditional wallets, including the display of transaction metadata and passkey domains, which mitigates the risk of blind-signing attacks. Two variants are available: the PHSM 8, featuring a premium aluminum chassis, dual Gorilla Glass, haptic feedback, and biometric input; and the PHSM 6, a compact USB-C dongle with the same cryptographic performance optimized for mobile or travel use. Both devices operate on CommandOS, a hardened operating system that ensures secure boot, firmware integrity, and encrypted data management.

Daric Secure MCU: Engineered for Cryptographic Assurance
At the hardware core is the Daric Secure MCU, a custom-designed system-on-chip built using a 22nm ULL process. It integrates an 800MHz ARM Cortex-M7 and a 400MHz RISC-V processor, providing dual-core performance for cryptographic processing and UI management. The embedded cryptographic engine supports modern asymmetric and symmetric primitives including ECDSA, Schnorr, EdDSA, RSA (up to 8192-bit), AES, SHA2/3, RIPEMD, BLAKE, and the Paillier homomorphic scheme.

Daric includes 4MB of ReRAM—radiation-hardened, non-volatile memory that is highly resistant to side-channel, probe, or microscopy attacks. Physical countermeasures include voltage glitch detection, mesh shielding, memory fault detection, tamper response with secret zeroization, and clock/power balancing for side-channel mitigation. The chip optionally includes an EAL 6+ certified Secure Element, establishing one of the strongest assurance levels for embedded cryptographic devices on the market.

Open Source: The Foundation of Verifiable Trust
Cramium is unique in offering complete transparency across all three custody layers. It has open-sourced its cryptographic SDKs and MPC protocols, the PHSM firmware and CommandOS, and even the RTL (register transfer level) design of the Daric chip. This transparency allows developers, auditors, and institutions to validate every cryptographic pathway, ensuring that no backdoors, proprietary logic, or unverifiable behaviors exist.

This open design not only enables deep audits and custom integrations but aligns with growing industry demand for compliance-ready systems. Cramium’s openness eliminates vendor lock-in and supports decentralized self-hosting. It fosters a collaborative security model where experts—including advisors like Bunnie Huang—contribute to a continuously improving infrastructure rooted in peer review and zero-trust principles.

Roadmap and Future Considerations
Cramium’s roadmap outlines significant advancements under evaluation or active development. These include a fully self-custodial MPC architecture (with no cloud dependency), peer-to-peer key exchange via QR codes, and WASM-based local signing for browser-based offline workflows. The team is also exploring EIP proposals for Ethereum to introduce precompiled Schnorr or EdDSA contracts, which would significantly reduce gas costs and expand linear signature usage in smart contracts. Expanded hardware support for third-party MPC participants is also in scope, ensuring broader composability across wallet and authentication devices.
