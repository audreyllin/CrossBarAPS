To address this problem, over sixty jurisdictions have\nrecently committed to implement the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF).\nCARF transposes the Common Reporting Standard (CRS)—designed for the\ntraditional financial industry—onto the crypto industry. Under CARF, certain\ncrypto intermediaries are treated like traditional financial institutions: they must\nidentify and report crypto owners who are tax residents of other jurisdictions.\nHowever, CARF is deeply flawed. This Article is the first to systematically\nanalyze alarming loopholes and weaknesses that bad actors may exploit to\navoid reporting. First, tax evaders may refrain from using compliant, in-scope\nintermediaries. The reliance on intermediaries was adopted by CRS for the\ntraditional financial system, but this would have limited success where crypto\nowners can avoid such intermediaries. ...\n\n\nTitle: 53e231809107edbcae56216530276f01.pdf\nURL: https://www.stern.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/2024-07/Glucksman_Sak_2024.pdf\nText length: 30468 characters\nPreview:\nKYC/AML Technologies in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\nMeng Hou Sak\nThe Leonard N.

DeFi has revolutionized traditional\nfinancial systems by leveraging blockchain technology to offer peer-to-peer transactions,\nlending, borrowing, and other services without intermediaries. However, regulatory compliance\nposes challenges due to the decentralized nature of DeFi platforms. With clear guidelines and\nstandards for DeFi platforms and applications, we can instill trust and credibility in DeFi\napplications, driving growth and innovation in this burgeoning sector, and encouraging increased\ninvestment, participation, and adoption in the long run.

Public keys, from which\nan alphanumeric identifier called an address is generated, can be shared to\nreceive funds.\nAs mentioned earlier, crypto assets are not stored in wallets. Instead, they are\nstored on the blockchain and may be accessed only by a private key. In order to\ntransmit crypto assets such as bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and tokens, a\nprivate key is used to sign the transaction and publish it to the blockchain\nnetwork.
