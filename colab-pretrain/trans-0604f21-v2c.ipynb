A: Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code.\",\n        \"Q: What is proof-of-stake? A: Consensus mechanism where validators stake crypto to secure network.\",\n        \"Q: What is a DAO? A: Decentralized Autonomous Organization governed by smart contracts.\",\n        \"Q: How do nodes add transactions to blocks and broadcast them? A: Miner or validator nodes compile pending transactions into blocks and broadcast them across the network. Once a block is verified and added to the chain, its transactions become immutable. Block inclusion ensures finality, preventing unauthorized alterations.\",\n        \"Q: What incentives and deterrents ensure nodes behave honestly? A: Nodes securing the network earn cryptocurrency rewards for processing valid transactions. PoW miners face high energy costs, discouraging fraud, while PoS validators risk losing staked assets if they act dishonestly. These mechanisms reinforce compliance with blockchain rules.\",\n        \"Q: Why are crypto nodes important? A: Crypto nodes uphold decentralization, ensuring networks operate securely without central oversight. They maintain transaction integrity, prevent manipulation, and facilitate independent verification. A large node presence enhances network resilience against attacks and unauthorized changes.\",\n        \"Q: What is the primary purpose of consensus protocols in blockchain? A: Consensus protocols ensure all nodes agree on transaction validity without central authority, preventing fraud and maintaining data integrity. Examples include PoW and PoS, which secure the network through different validation methods.\",\n        \"Q: How does Proof of Work (PoW) secure blockchain networks? A: PoW requires miners to solve cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and create blocks. This energy-intensive process deters fraud, as attacking the network would require excessive computing power. Bitcoin uses PoW to prevent double-spending.\",\n        \"Q: Why is Proof of Stake (PoS) considered energy-efficient? A: PoS selects validators based on staked cryptocurrency, eliminating energy-intensive mining. Validators lock assets as collateral, incentivizing honesty while reducing environmental impact. Ethereum’s transition to PoS highlights its efficiency.\",\n        \"Q: What role do nodes play in consensus mechanisms?

Variants like PBFT improve efficiency in distributed systems.\",\n        \"Q: What is a 51% attack and its impact? A: A 51% attack occurs when an entity controls most mining/stake power, enabling transaction manipulation. It compromises integrity, erodes trust, and may devalue assets. Major blockchains resist it via decentralization, but smaller networks are vulnerable.\",\n        \"Q: Why is decentralization critical for consensus security? A: Decentralization prevents single points of control, making manipulation and collusion difficult. Distributed validation across nodes strengthens blockchain integrity and resistance to attacks like 51% control.\",\n        \"Q: How does a decentralized system distribute power? A: Power is allocated among participants, preventing dominance by any single entity. Nodes collectively validate transactions, ensuring fairness and trust in blockchain networks.\",\n        \"Q: How does decentralization reduce collusion risks? A: Dispersed control makes coordinated fraud unlikely, as influencing consensus requires disproportionate resources. Bitcoin and Ethereum exemplify networks where decentralization minimizes security risks.\",\n        \"Q: How does decentralization enhance security? A: Distributing data and validation across nodes prevents single points of failure and reduces attack susceptibility. Bitcoin’s integrity relies on this decentralized structure.\",\n        \"Q: How does decentralization enable trustless collaboration? A: Participants rely on cryptographic verification, not mutual trust, for secure interactions. This supports DeFi and smart contracts by eliminating intermediaries.\",\n        \"Q: How does decentralization resist censorship? A: No central authority can alter or restrict transactions, as nodes collectively validate activity. This ensures transparency and accessibility in financial systems.\",\n        \"Q: How does Nakamoto Consensus resolve conflicts? A: It prioritizes the longest valid chain (with the most PoW), ensuring stability in Bitcoin’s decentralized system by preventing transaction inconsistencies.\",\n        \"Q: What happens to forks in a decentralized network? A: Temporary forks resolve when the network adopts the chain with the most PoW/stake, ensuring consensus and preventing duplicate transactions.\",\n        \"Q: What are key features of PoS? A: PoS selects validators based on staked assets, offering energy efficiency and economic incentives for honesty. However, it may process transactions slower than DPoS.\",\n        \"Q: What are key features of DPoS? A: DPoS uses elected delegates for faster transactions but risks centralization. Token holders vote for and can remove delegates, balancing efficiency with governance.\",\n        \"Q: How does DPoS differ from PoS? A: DPoS introduces delegation for speed and governance, potentially sacrificing decentralization. PoS allows direct participation by all stakers.\",\n        \"Q: Why is Sybil resistance essential? A: It prevents fake identities from gaining network control, ensuring fairness. PoW and PoS mitigate Sybil attacks by requiring work or collateral.\",\n        \"Q: How does Sybil resistance maintain integrity? A: It ensures consensus reflects legitimate participants, preventing manipulation and preserving decentralized governance.\",\n        \"Q: How do consensus protocols achieve scalability? A: Methods include increasing block size, faster validation (e.g., PoS), Layer-2 solutions (rollups), and sharding for parallel processing.\",\n        \"Q: What is the 'nothing at stake' problem in PoS? A: Validators can support multiple forks at no cost, risking consensus instability. Solutions like slashing penalties discourage this behavior.\",\n        \"Q: What are Layer-2 solutions? A: They process transactions off-chain (e.g., rollups) before submitting data to the main chain, boosting throughput while retaining security.\",\n        \"Q: What is sharding? A: It partitions the blockchain into smaller segments (shards) for parallel processing, reducing node overhead and improving scalability.\",\n        \"Q: How do Secure Elements defend against OS-level malware?

The private key grants full control over an account, while the public key allows others to send assets to that account securely. Blockchain addresses are derived from hashed versions of public keys, ensuring authenticity while maintaining privacy.\",\n        \"Q: How to create a transaction? A: A transaction starts as an intent in a crypto wallet, where details such as sender's address, recipient's address, and the transfer amount are specified. The user reviews and approves the transaction before it proceeds to signing. Conditions like transaction fees or time constraints may also be set during this stage.\",\n        \"Q: How to sign the transaction? A: Signing a transaction involves using the sender's private key to create a cryptographic signature, confirming ownership and approval. This signature ensures the transaction's integrity, proving the sender has authorized the transfer. The signed transaction is then broadcast to the blockchain network for validation.\",\n        \"Q: How is a signed transaction distributed to nodes? A: Once signed, the transaction enters the mempool, a temporary storage area within nodes where transactions await processing. Each node maintains its own mempool, which may differ in validation order or accessibility. Some block creators keep private mempools, prioritizing their own transactions.\",\n        \"Q: How is a transaction verified in the mempool? A: Nodes categorize transactions as queued or pending before validation. Using the sender's public key, nodes check if the account holds sufficient assets and verify the signature's authenticity. Once confirmed, the transaction is passed to the next node, continuing the verification process.\",\n        \"Q: What are block creators?

Blocks have limited space, and priority may depend on transaction fees, similar to first-class passengers boarding early.\",\n        \"Q: Why is a block like a bus? A: Just as buses can only accommodate a certain number of passengers, blockchain blocks have limited storage capacity. Transactions vary in size and priority, with some paying higher fees for faster inclusion. This mechanism ensures efficient processing and fair access to block space.\",\n        \"Q: How does the ticket officer correspond to the consensus mechanism? A: Just like a ticket officer checks passengers for valid tickets before boarding, the consensus mechanism verifies transaction validity before adding them to the blockchain. Verified transactions are placed in a queue, waiting to be processed by a block creator, who functions like a bus driver. Block creators prioritize transactions with higher fees, similar to a bus driver prioritizing high-paying passengers. This fee-based competition can increase transaction costs during periods of high network congestion.\",\n        \"Q: What are crypto nodes and how do they work?

A: While cryptocurrencies serve as mediums of exchange, they lack full adoption as money due to volatility, limited merchant acceptance, and regulatory hurdles. Bitcoin acts as a store of value, but its role as a unit of account remains weak compared to traditional currencies.\",\n        \"Q: Withdrawing Crypto from Exchanges A: Users transfer cryptocurrency to non-custodial wallets by inputting a public address. Compatibility must be verified between wallet and asset type to prevent loss, with network fees varying based on congestion.\",\n        \"Q: Generating Private Keys A: Private keys can be generated via entropy-based methods such as dice rolls or open-source tools like Bitaddress. Hardware wallets remain the safest option, as they use secure elements to generate and store keys offline.\",\n        \"Q: Bitcoin Value Drivers A: Bitcoin's value derives from its fixed supply (21 million BTC), decentralized network, robust security, and use case as a censorship-resistant digital currency. Market perception, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic factors further influence price stability.\",\n        \"Q: Wallet Security Practices A: Hardware wallets ensure maximum security for long-term holdings by keeping private keys offline. Software wallets offer convenience for daily transactions but should be used cautiously, with multi-factor authentication and limited balances.\",\n        \"Q: Account Takeover Prevention A: Prevent unauthorized access by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), using hardware security keys, and storing assets in cold storage. Avoid phishing links and regularly update security settings to mitigate account breaches.\",\n        \"Q: Crypto Airdrops A: Projects distribute free tokens to users to encourage adoption, liquidity, and ecosystem growth. Airdrops can reward early supporters, incentivize participation, or distribute governance tokens in decentralized platforms.\",\n        \"Q: Bitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin A: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) prioritizes faster transactions by increasing block size, while Bitcoin (BTC) focuses on security and serving as a store of value. BCH facilitates everyday payments but has lower adoption than BTC.\",\n        \"Q: Dusting Attack Motivations A: Attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency to wallets to de-anonymize holders, advertise services, stress-test network vulnerabilities, or obscure illicit financial trails. Privacy tools like CoinJoin help mitigate tracking risks.\",\n        \"Q: Vampire Attack (DeFi) A: A competitive strategy where a DeFi protocol incentivizes liquidity providers to migrate from an established platform. For instance, SushiSwap attracted users from Uniswap by offering higher rewards, accelerating decentralized exchange competition.\",\n        \"Q: Bitcoin System Features A: Bitcoin operates as a decentralized, censorship-resistant financial system with a fixed supply of 21 million BTC. Transactions are secured via Proof of Work (PoW), making mining energy-intensive but ensuring security and immutability.\",\n        \"Q: Oracles (Blockchain) A: Blockchain oracles provide external data to smart contracts, enabling applications like decentralized finance (DeFi), insurance, and prediction markets. Services like Chainlink ensure secure off-chain data transmission for automated contract execution.\",\n        \"Q: SushiSwap Impact A: SushiSwap disrupted DeFi by demonstrating how community-driven projects can challenge incumbents. It pushed protocols toward decentralization, fair token launches, and governance improvements across liquidity pools and automated market makers.\",\n        \"Q: Wallet Selection Strategy A: Users should balance security and accessibility by using hardware wallets for savings and software wallets for everyday transactions. Multi-signature and mobile wallets offer additional layers of security depending on use case.\",\n        \"Q: Trustless System Risks A: While blockchain eliminates intermediaries, risks arise from poorly coded smart contracts, governance flaws, and security vulnerabilities. Audits, insurance mechanisms, and decentralized governance mitigate threats in DeFi ecosystems.\",\n        \"Q: Paper Wallet Risks A: Paper wallets offer offline security but require careful management. Users must set change addresses to prevent accidental loss, and sweeping keys into secure wallets is safer than importing.\",\n        \"Q: Bitcoin's Value Proposition A: Bitcoin combines scarcity, portability, security, and censorship resistance, making it a viable store of value akin to 'digital gold.' Its decentralized design prevents government interference but introduces volatility risks.\",\n        \"Q: Cold Wallet Pros/Cons A: Cold wallets ensure maximum security against online threats but are less convenient for frequent transactions. Hardware wallets, costing ~$100–$200, protect large holdings while balancing usability and offline security.\",\n        \"Q: What is a blockchain node? A: A blockchain node is a computer that helps run a blockchain network. It checks transactions, keeps a copy of the ledger, and ensures the network stays secure. Different types include full nodes (store all data), light nodes (store partial data), and miner nodes (validate transactions in proof-of-work systems).\",  \n        \"Q: How do international sanctions apply to DeFi? A: Sanctions can target DeFi by blocking transactions linked to banned individuals or entities. Even though DeFi is decentralized, regulators may force exchanges or developers to restrict access. Example: Tornado Cash faced sanctions, but its smart contracts kept running since they can’t be easily shut down.\",  \n        \"Q: How do smart contracts interact with traditional contract law? A: Smart contracts automate agreements but still follow legal rules. Courts can enforce them if they meet basic contract requirements (offer, acceptance, consideration). If code errors cause issues, traditional law provides ways to fix disputes.\",  \n        \"Q: How do qualified custodians verify ownership of wrapped tokens? A: Custodians check ownership by auditing reserves (e.g., ensuring 1 BTC backs each WBTC). They use digital signatures to confirm transactions and only mint/burn tokens when real assets are deposited/withdrawn. Example: WBTC custodians hold Bitcoin reserves and issue tokens on Ethereum.\",  \n        \"Q: What insurance models cover crypto custody risks? A: Common models include custody insurance (theft protection), staking insurance (slashing risks), and hybrid coverage (self-custody with backup). Example: BitGo offers $250M in custody insurance, while GK8 covers $1B for cold storage.\",  \n        \"Q: How do MPC wallets improve security? A: MPC wallets split private keys into pieces, requiring multiple approvals for transactions. This removes single points of failure—no one holds the full key. Example: Fireblocks uses MPC to secure funds for exchanges.\",  \n        \"Q: What’s the difference between custodial and non-custodial wallets? A: Custodial wallets (like exchanges) manage keys for users, offering convenience but centralizing risk. Non-custodial wallets (like MetaMask) give users full control but require them to secure their own keys.\",  \n        \"Q: How does IRS guidance impact crypto custody? A: Starting in 2026, custodians must report user transactions to the IRS, similar to stock brokers. This forces institutions to track and disclose sales, ensuring tax compliance.\",  \n        \"Q: What are jurisdictional conflicts in crypto enforcement? A: Crypto’s borderless nature creates disputes over which laws apply. Example: A DeFi hack involving U.S. users and overseas developers may face conflicting regulations from multiple countries.\",  \n        \"Q: Why are privacy coins hard to regulate? A: Privacy coins hide transaction details, making it tough to track illegal activity. Regulators ban or restrict them (e.g., Monero, Zcash) due to money laundering risks.\",  \n        \"Q: How does the SEC classify novel token sales? A: The SEC uses the Howey Test: if buyers expect profits from others’ efforts, it’s likely a security. Example: A token sale promoting future returns could trigger SEC rules, while utility tokens might not.\",  \n        \"Q: What are gaps in stablecoin regulation? A: Key gaps include unclear reserve rules, weak consumer protections, and inconsistent global oversight. Example: Some stablecoins lack transparency about their cash reserves.\",  \n        \"Q: How do state laws like Nebraska’s interact with federal crypto rules? A: State laws (e.g., Nebraska’s digital asset banks) add local frameworks but still require federal compliance (e.g., anti-money laundering checks). They let state-chartered banks offer crypto services under dual oversight.\",  \n        \"Q: How does the FATF Travel Rule apply to crypto? A: Crypto exchanges must share sender/receiver info for transfers over $1,000, similar to banks. Challenges include tracking self-hosted wallets and aligning global standards.\",  \n        \"Q: What’s a qualified custodian under SEC rules? A: Banks, broker-dealers, or trust companies that meet SEC standards for safeguarding assets. They must segregate client funds and provide regular account statements.\",  \n        \"Q: What’s the difference between on-chain and off-chain governance? A: On-chain governance uses token voting (e.g., Tezos), while off-chain relies on forums and developer consensus (e.g., Bitcoin). On-chain is transparent but rigid; off-chain is flexible but less formal.\",  \n        \"Q: What risks do bridge hacks pose? A: Bridge hacks (e.g., Ronin’s $600M exploit) drain funds by exploiting smart contract bugs. They disrupt cross-chain transactions and erode trust in interoperability tools.\",  \n        \"Q: How do atomic swaps work? A: Atomic swaps let users trade tokens across blockchains without intermediaries. HTLC smart contracts lock funds until both parties confirm—either the full swap happens or nothing does.\",  \n        \"Q: What is cross-chain communication? A: It lets blockchains share data/assets (e.g., Ethereum ↔ Polygon). Bridges or protocols like Cosmos IBC enable this, but centralization in some bridges creates security risks.\",  \n        \"Q: What are Layer 2 solutions? A: L2s (e.g., Arbitrum, Lightning Network) process transactions off the main chain for speed/cost savings. They batch data and submit proofs back to Layer 1 (e.g., Ethereum) for security.\",  \n        \"Q: What’s the decentralization vs. scalability trade-off? A: More nodes (decentralization) slow transactions; fewer nodes (scalability) risk centralization. Example: Solana sacrifices some decentralization for speed, while Bitcoin prioritizes decentralization.\",  \n        \"Q: How does sharding improve performance? A: Sharding splits a blockchain into parallel chains (shards), each processing transactions. This boosts throughput (e.g., Ethereum 2.0 aims for 100,000 TPS via sharding).\",  \n        \"Q: How can AI improve blockchain security? A: AI detects anomalies (e.g., unusual transactions) and predicts attacks. Example: Machine learning can flag phishing attempts or smart contract exploits before they cause harm.\",  \n        \"Q: What are risks of browser-based wallets? A: They’re vulnerable to phishing, malware, or rogue extensions. Example: A fake MetaMask site can steal keys. Use hardware wallets for large holdings.\"\n    ]\n    return Dataset.from_dict({\"text\": crypto_qa})\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-05T05:25:57.333132Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-05T05:25:57.333396Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-05T05:25:57.416391Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-05T05:25:57.333378Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-05T05:25:57.415519Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def prepare_dataset(file_path=\"/kaggle/input/database4\", max_samples=1000):\n    try:\n        print(f\"\\n🔍 Searching for dataset at: {file_path}\")\n        data_path = Path(file_path)\n        \n        if not data_path.exists():\n            raise FileNotFoundError(f\"Dataset path not found: {data_path}\")\n        \n        # 1.
