This forces institutions to track and disclose sales, ensuring tax compliance.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"What are jurisdictional conflicts in crypto enforcement?\", \"answer\": \"Crypto’s borderless nature creates disputes over which laws apply. Example: A DeFi hack involving U.S. users and overseas developers may face conflicting regulations from multiple countries.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"Why are privacy coins hard to regulate?\", \"answer\": \"Privacy coins hide transaction details, making it tough to track illegal activity. Regulators ban or restrict them (e.g., Monero, Zcash) due to money laundering risks.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"How does the SEC classify novel token sales?\", \"answer\": \"The SEC uses the Howey Test: if buyers expect profits from others’ efforts, it’s likely a security. Example: A token sale promoting future returns could trigger SEC rules, while utility tokens might not.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"What are gaps in stablecoin regulation?\", \"answer\": \"Key gaps include unclear reserve rules, weak consumer protections, and inconsistent global oversight. Example: Some stablecoins lack transparency about their cash reserves.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"How do state laws like Nebraska’s interact with federal crypto rules?\", \"answer\": \"State laws (e.g., Nebraska’s digital asset banks) add local frameworks but still require federal compliance (e.g., anti-money laundering checks). They let state-chartered banks offer crypto services under dual oversight.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"How does the FATF Travel Rule apply to crypto?\", \"answer\": \"Crypto exchanges must share sender/receiver info for transfers over $1,000, similar to banks. Challenges include tracking self-hosted wallets and aligning global standards.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"What’s a qualified custodian under SEC rules?\", \"answer\": \"Banks, broker-dealers, or trust companies that meet SEC standards for safeguarding assets. They must segregate client funds and provide regular account statements.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"What’s the difference between on-chain and off-chain governance?\", \"answer\": \"On-chain governance uses token voting (e.g., Tezos), while off-chain relies on forums and developer consensus (e.g., Bitcoin). On-chain is transparent but rigid; off-chain is flexible but less formal.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"What risks do bridge hacks pose?\", \"answer\": \"Bridge hacks (e.g., Ronin’s $600M exploit) drain funds by exploiting smart contract bugs. They disrupt cross-chain transactions and erode trust in interoperability tools.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"How do atomic swaps work?\", \"answer\": \"Atomic swaps let users trade tokens across blockchains without intermediaries. HTLC smart contracts lock funds until both parties confirm—either the full swap happens or nothing does.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"What is cross-chain communication?\", \"answer\": \"It lets blockchains share data/assets (e.g., Ethereum ↔ Polygon). Bridges or protocols like Cosmos IBC enable this, but centralization in some bridges creates security risks.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"What are Layer 2 solutions?\", \"answer\": \"L2s (e.g., Arbitrum, Lightning Network) process transactions off the main chain for speed/cost savings. They batch data and submit proofs back to Layer 1 (e.g., Ethereum) for security.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"What’s the decentralization vs. scalability trade-off?\", \"answer\": \"More nodes (decentralization) slow transactions; fewer nodes (scalability) risk centralization. Example: Solana sacrifices some decentralization for speed, while Bitcoin prioritizes decentralization.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"How does sharding improve performance?\", \"answer\": \"Sharding splits a blockchain into parallel chains (shards), each processing transactions. This boosts throughput (e.g., Ethereum 2.0 aims for 100,000 TPS via sharding).\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"How can AI improve blockchain security?\", \"answer\": \"AI detects anomalies (e.g., unusual transactions) and predicts attacks. Example: Machine learning can flag phishing attempts or smart contract exploits before they cause harm.\"},  \n        {\"question\": \"What are risks of browser-based wallets?\", \"answer\": \"They’re vulnerable to phishing, malware, or rogue extensions. Example: A fake MetaMask site can steal keys. Use hardware wallets for large holdings.\"}\n    ]\n\n    # Process and store static Q&A pairs\n    print(\"\\nProcessing static Q&A pairs...\")\n    processed_pairs = []\n    for pair in
