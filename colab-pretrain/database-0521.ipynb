Gox exchange attack (850,000 BTC) have resulted in significant financial losses, affecting individual users and various entities relying on the service.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are software wallets?\", \"ans\": \"Software wallets are applications that manage private keys or transaction authorization conditions within a software environment.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the prevalent software infrastructure designs?\", \"ans\": \"Existing software infrastructure designs include desktop, browser, mobile, and smart contract wallets.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Exemplify and briefly explain 2 software wallets (eg. desktop wallets and browser wallets)\", \"ans\": \"Desktop wallets are installed on computers and typically store the private keys on a local file in the computer’s file system of the software environment. Browser wallets present an alternative setup, as programs are installed or built into the web browser and credentials are typically stored in the browser’s local storage.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the examples of current browser wallets\", \"ans\": \"Two existing designs are browser extensions such as Metamask and Phantom and built-in browser-native such as Brave.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the another common software wallet type other than desktop and browser wallets\", \"ans\": \"Another prevalent wallet type is the mobile wallet which is installed on devices with limited computing power and storage capability in comparison with PCs.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Sum up the functions of mobile walltes\", \"ans\": \"Mobile wallets also typically store the private keys locally and can enhance security with mobile OS integrations such as the Android Keystore and iOS Keychain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What do smart contract wallets do considering the risk of losing private keys and random seed?\", \"ans\": \"Smart contract wallets (e.g. Argent and Safe) are deployed on the blockchain to abstract typical sk management and create advanced transaction functions such as multi-factor authentication, ownership assignments, spending limits, and recovery mechanisms, often through integration with centralised or decentralised relayers.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why are crypto wallets still vulnerable and esily targeted by specific attacks?\", \"ans\": \"Due to the immutable nature of blockchain, these wallets are susceptible to specific vulnerabilities despite their advanced capabilities.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Imperfect implementations and access control in parity wallt can cause what?\", \"ans\": \"Flawed implementation and access control in parity wallet resulted in significant financial losses.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What do harware wallets do?\", \"ans\": \"Hardware wallets typically involve the private key management within a secure element (SE) (e.g. microcontroller or smart card), to protect against tampering and facilitate the execution of cryptographic operations, such as transaction signing.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the unique designs of hardware wallets\", \"ans\": \" Isolated in design with no internet connectivity functionality, their mechanism operates by performing all cryptographic operations on an offline hardware device and typically requires a distinct online device to create and broadcast transactions.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How to connect the offline hardware wallet with the online hardware wallet\", \"ans\": \"The connection between both devices can be achieved by Bluetooth (e.g. Ledger), USB (e.g. Trezor), NFC (e.g. Tangem) and QR codes (e.g. Ngrave).\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Explain the definition of custody design\", \"ans\": \"The degree of private key control by an entity or between one or more entities defines custody design. Custody setups include custodial, non-custodial and semi-custodial.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is custodial?\", \"ans\": \"The private key is stored by a trusted custodian (e.g. Coinbase, Binance, Kraken) who signs user-initiated transactions in this model.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the 2 important custodial design variations\", \"ans\": \"An omnibus setup, where the custodian aggregates and controls all users’ funds under a few shared addresses, without a one-to-one correspondence between user accounts and addresses; and a segregated setup, where each user is assigned a unique blockchain address, with the custodian retaining control of the associated private keys.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What happen in non-custodial wqallet architectures?\", \"ans\": \"In non-custodial wallet architectures, (e.g. Metamask, Phantom, Ledger) the user does not relinquish any control to any custodian party. Instead, a direct interaction between the user and the blockchain network exists in these setups with the user in full control of the private key, to facilitate all the wallet operations. With full autonomy, the user is solely responsible for securing the private key and is more susceptible to insecure user interaction threats as well as other vulnerabilities and attacks such as social engineering attacks and malware-based attacks, which aim to exploit user negligence. While non-custodial wallets are expected to not have credential control, a few incidents in the past (e.g. Slope Wallet have resulted in the private key compromise due to poor implementation practices, insecure storage of sensitive information, or inadvertent leaks.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do shared-custodial wallets function?\", \"ans\": \"Shared-custodial wallets strike a balance between custodial and non-custodial models by enabling joint control of the secret key (sk) between a user and a custodian. In this setup, the sk is split or distributed across two or more parties, allowing the user to delegate a degree of transaction authorisation rights and trust to the custodian. This arrangement provides both parties with partial control over the wallet’s signing and recovery operations. As a result, even if one party’s security is compromised, the risk of a complete sk compromise is mitigated. For example, Zengo’s operational model implements shared custody with Multi-Party Computation (MPC) by storing one part of the sk on Zengo’s centralised server, while the other part remains on the user’s device.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"In 1 sentence, explain what is initialization?\", \"ans\": \"This pertains to the creation of the wallet through sk generation  or contract deployment.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What do you mean by sk\", \"ans\": \"In the context of digital wallets and cryptocurrency, \"SK\" typically refers to the \"Secret Key\" or \"private key\". This is the key that grants access to the funds stored in your digital wallet. It's analogous to a password or a key to a safe, allowing you to spend the cryptocurrency associated with your wallet.},\n        {\"que\": \"Give me a more detailed explanation of SK\", \"ans\": \"SK as the Private Key is a unique, secret alphanumeric string that is generated when you create a crypto wallet address. It's used to sign transactions, proving that you are the owner of the funds. It's crucial to keep this key safe and secure, as anyone who possesses it can access and spend your cryptocurrency.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Give me a detailed explanation of digital wallets\", \"ans\": \"Digital wallets are software applications or hardware devices that store and manage your private keys. They allow you to interact with the blockchain network, sending and receiving cryptocurrency.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Give out a specific explanation of public key\", \"ans\": \"Public key as the wallet address is derived from your private key and is the address where you receive cryptocurrency. It's like your bank account number, publicly shared.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Breifly explain blockchain in 1 sentence\", \"ans\": \"The underlying technology for cryptocurrencies, where transactions are recorded and verified.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Briefly explain SK in 1 sentence\", \"ans\": \"In essence, the SK (private key) is the digital equivalent of the \"key\" that unlocks your crypto wallet and gives you control over your cryptocurrency assets.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Give out an exact explanation of secure hardware wallets\", \"ans\": \"Physical devices designed to securely store private keys, offering a higher level of security than software wallets.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is Blockchain?\", \"ans\": \"A blockchain is an immutable digital ledger that records every single transaction ever made. Blockchain networks provide the foundations for cryptocurrency, allowing peer-to-peer transactions. The trustless capabilities of blockchain technology sparked off an entire DeFi industry that could challenge traditional banking.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Elaborate what blockchain is\", \"ans\": \"In simple words, a blockchain is a distributed and immutable digital ledger that is responsible for recording transactions and tracking the movement of digital assets on its network. Primarily, blockchains were used to track financial assets but today, there are a growing number of use cases as the blockchain is a fantastic way to store value. Blockchains have some key features that open up a new world of functionality, a concept often named ‘Web3’.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"what are the key features of a blockchain network\", \"ans\": \"Blockchains have a lot of other interesting features. However, they all start with these two main pillars: distributed Ledger technology, and immutable records.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is distributed ledger technology?\", \"ans\": \"Instead of hosting its information on a single centralized server, a blockchain distributes its ledger to each and every computer in the system. These computers are called nodes and they are responsible for storing, sharing, and recording information and the transfer of digital assets. This is the basis of “distributed ledger” technology, and it’s the only way in which blockchains can store information securely.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the immutable records?\", \"ans\": \"A blockchain has a unique way of storing that information: within blocks. These blocks of new information are arranged in a chain, which is distributed across the network, hence the name ‘blockchain’. To clarify, this specific data structure ensures that it is impossible to alter information once included in the blockchain. These features make blockchains almost impossible to hack.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Wht are blockchains for?\", \"ans\": \"Sending money digitally is very different from sending information, such as an email or picture. For any currency to have value, its supply needs to be finite. In a successful digital transaction, value needs to be received by the receiving party, while the exact same value disappears from the sender’s account. If it doesn’t happen that way, it’s called double-spending.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Wait, what is double-spending?\", \"ans\": \"That term might be unfamiliar to you, but doubles-spending is the lynchpin for our entire financial system and our reliance on banks.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What does double spending mean in blockchain\", \"ans\": \"In the context of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, double-spending refers to the scenario where the same digital currency is used in multiple transactions, effectively spending it more than once. This creates a situation where a recipient might believe they have received payment when, in reality, the funds have been spent elsewhere.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the problem of double-spending\", \"ans\": \"Double-spending undermines the trust and integrity of a digital currency because it allows for fraudulent transactions. A malicious user could potentially spend the same funds to multiple parties, leading to confusion and financial losses for the legitimate recipient(s).\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Hows does double-spending happen?\", \"ans\": \"Double-spending can occur if a transaction is not properly validated or if a malicious actor manipulates the blockchain to create conflicting transactions.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does blockchain prevent double-spending?\", \"ans\": \"Blockchain technology addresses the double-spending problem through a few key mechanisms: Blockchain consensus, timestamps and immutability, and mining and confirmation.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is blockchain consensus?\", \"ans\": \"The blockchain network utilizes a consensus algorithm (like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake) to verify and confirm transactions. This process ensures that only one transaction is recorded and recognized as valid.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is timestamps and immutability?\", \"ans\": \"Transactions on a blockchain are timestamped and recorded in blocks, which are then chained together. Once a transaction is included in a block, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to alter or reverse.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is mining and confirmation?\", \"ans\": \"Miners play a crucial role in validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. The more confirmations a transaction has, the more likely it is to be considered valid and finalized.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Exemplify double-spending\", \"ans\": \"Imagine Alice pays Bob with 1 Bitcoin. If Alice could somehow \"double-spend\" the same Bitcoin and pay Carol as well, both Bob and Carol would be left with the impression they had received the funds, when in reality, the Bitcoin had only been spent once.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the types of blockchain?\", \"ans\": \"There are several ways to build a blockchain network and there’s likely a bit more to it than you thought. When most people think of blockchains, they are referring to decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin. But is worth mentioning this technology can also build centralized systems. Just because blockchains allow for the peer-to-peer transfer and decentralized exchange of value, that doesn’t mean all blockchains operate in this way. Some blockchains are public, private, permissioned, or built by a consortium. Some are even a combination of some of these types.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is permissioned blockchain\", \"ans\": \"A permissioned blockchain is run by a single entity, such as a government or a company. As a result, the central entity can limit access to the system and who can operate a node. Plus, those who do operate nodes have a lot of power – power they could misuse.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Define private blockchain\", \"ans\": \"By definition, these blockchains are always permissioned. But they actually take it one step further. Private blockchains don’t just limit who can operate a node, they also limit who can access the system. This is a completely centralized system and it allows entities to protect users’ identities and data. As a result, these systems are preferred by governments or trade groups aiming to keep control over the system and its data.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Exemplify private blockchain\", \"ans\": \"A good example of a private blockchain is Hyperledger. In this case, it uses a private system in order to keep user data (such as shipping information) away from prying eyes. In this case, having a transparent blockchain would pose a privacy risk.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is consortium blockchain\", \"ans\": \"Consortium Blockchains are also permissioned blockchains, but instead of being governed by a single entity, it’s a group of organizations responsible for its management. This method is popular for financial systems which would like to cooperate. These blockchains can process transactions quickly as they verify changes using a voting system.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"I know permissoned blockchain now. So, what is a permissionless blockchain\", \"ans\": \"A permissionless blockchain will allow anyone to operate a node in the network. In this system, there tend to be more participants and they could live anywhere in the world. This does make them slower than their private and permissioned counterparts. However, the bigger the system is, the easier it is to police participants with bad intentions. Thus, a permissionless blockchain’s decentralized nature makes it much more secure than its private counterparts.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Are there any public blockchains that are permissionless\", \"ans\": \"There are also public blockchains that are, by definition, permissionless. Not only do they allow anyone to join the network, they treat all nodes equally and all of the network’s data is readily available to every participant. Public Blockchains are great for cryptocurrencies as they are transparent, secure, and auditable. A good example of a public blockchain is the Bitcoin Network.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does a blockchain work?\", \"ans\": \"As mentioned, a blockchain network stores data on all of the computers participating in the network, otherwise known as nodes. Crypto nodes contribute to the security of the network by taking part in the transaction validation process. Each of these nodes stores information in blocks. Then each of these blocks is arranged in a chain. Every time the network processes a transaction, the chain grows.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Does the nodes store information in a readable way in human language?\", \"ans\": \"No, the nodes don’t store information in a way you could read it. Instead, it uses a cryptographic hash. To protect sensitive information included in a transaction, the node converts the information into a string of numbers and letters and then stores it in each block.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What does the cryptographic has include?\", \"ans\": \"The cryptographic hash doesn’t just include the information of the block it corresponds to, it also includes information on the previous block in the chain. This means if anyone alters one block, it will also alter its hash and therefore every subsequent block in the chain. This makes any potential edit very noticeable to the whole network, meaning it is secure. The earlier the transaction is in a blockchain’s history, the harder it becomes to alter the data. This capability means blockchains are a unique medium for storing valuable data.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How are blockchains secured?\", \"ans\": \"For permissioned and private blockchains, the controlling entity will usually organize a vote. However, public blockchains, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, have found a method to stay secure in a more decentralized way: by using a consensus mechanism.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is a consensus mechanism?\", \"ans\": \"This is the cleverest part of a public blockchain: There are thousands of nodes scattered across the planet, and the majority of them must verify each new transaction before it can join the blockchain. Once the block is added, every node in a blockchain must arrive at the same state. This is called achieving consensus. With the management of the blockchain ledger distributed so widely, no single entity can gain control of the network or validate false information. This makes the whole network secure. But the way in which these nodes process transactions differs slightly depending on the consensus mechanism the blockchain uses. Plus, each method has its advantages and disadvantages.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is PoW?\", \"ans\": \"Proof-of-Work is a slower, secure consensus mechanism, which uses miners to create new coins and process transactions by solving complex puzzles which take a lot of computational power. This keeps the network secure as it makes the system pointless for miners to try and cheat – the cost of using that much energy is simply too expensive to make it worth it. A good example of a PoW blockchain is Bitcoin.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is PoS?\", \"ans\": \"Proof-of-Stake is a faster, energy-efficient consensus mechanism that uses validators to process transactions. Instead of using computational power to prove their trustworthiness, validators in a PoS blockchain use significant amounts of crypto as collateral. To learn more, read the full article on crypto staking, but basically, validators are incentivized to behave honorably. In short, they receive rewards for acting well and are punished for acting maliciously. A good example of a blockchain that uses this system is Ethereum.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What's worth exciting for about blockchain\", \"ans\": \"Blockchain isn’t just about crypto and finance, these networks are also capable of some other novel uses. For example, some blockchain networks are capable of executing smart contracts, which are like the blockchain’s version of a computer program. Without getting too technical, smart contracts opened up a whole cultural revolution in blockchain technology. For example, decentralized finance apps which allow lending and borrowing are only possible due to this capability. Plus, blockchain games and blockchain art in the form of Non-fungible tokens become possible too. These programs also opened up the possibility of decentralized metaverse platforms, such as The Sandbox and Decentraland. Then, Blockchain technology even has the power to change the way we govern things. That’s because tokens and coins make it possible to create complex decentralized voting systems in the form of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (or DAOs).\"},\n        {\"que\": \"In short, what's the potential implications of blockchain\", \"ans\": \"As the innovation in the web3 industry grows, the potential for more and more use cases grows along with it. Put simply, Blockchain technology is here to stay and who knows what else it could do in the future.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does a blockchain transaction work?\", \"ans\": \"Even if you’re familiar with crypto, you might still be unsure of exactly how a blockchain transaction works. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that is kept running by various parties, such as nodes and miners, all of whom have the incentive to act. Factors such as transaction size, timing, block size and network usage all affect how your transaction will take place. Understanding the mechanics of that system will help you navigate your future transactions.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is a blockchain transaction?\", \"ans\": \"In very simple terms, a blockchain transaction is when one person transfers a digital asset they own to another person. The transaction itself will always include; the amount, the destination of the funds and a signature to prove its authenticity. Plus, you’ll usually initiate a blockchain transaction using a crypto wallet’s interface.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is a blockchain transaction for, in terms of decentralized p2p transfer\", \"ans\": \"The most obvious use-case of a blockchain transaction is the decentralized peer-to-peer transfer of digital assets. See, the information on a public blockchain is stored, maintained and processed by multiple computers in the network called nodes. Whereas internet data lives on servers with a single gatekeeper, there are multiple nodes storing blockchain data, with each node storing a full copy of the chain. This means blockchains can process peer-to-peer transfers in a way that wasn’t previously possible. Since transactions are processed by nodes in a network, you don’t need to rely on a centralized entity. Plus, you can transact with strangers without worrying about if they will hold up their end of the bargain—the network will make sure they do.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is blockchain transaction for, regarding authentication and verification\", \"ans\": \"A blockchain transaction is also for proving ownership over funds, a specific address, or even a specific asset. It may surprise you that this doesn’t always need to be for financial reasons though. Many blockchain transactions are also for the purpose of proving ownership over on-chain certificates or even specifically for allowing users access to token-gated platforms.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Briefly explain how does a blockchain transaction stay secure?\", \"ans\": \"Essentially, the public key cryptography keeps your blockchain transactions safe on a public network.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is public key cryptography?\", \"ans\": \" To explain, you can’t have a transfer from person to person without separate accounts. Accounts on blockchain networks work using public and private key pairs. These two “keys” are each a series of letters and numbers but they have an important purpose. Your private key has the power to control your entire account. This allows you to make decisions on the blockchain, or in other words, sign transactions. Your public key serves the opposite purpose. Although it is derived from your private key, meaning they have an inherent link, your public key is safe to share with anyone. No one can gain access to your account with only the public key, meaning this is the address you can use to receive assets—even from strangers. In fact, the blockchain address you use to receive crypto from friends is simply a hashed version of this public key. Since your public key is included in any transaction you sign with your private key, all participants on a blockchain can check the validity of a transaction. The system verifies the signature itself, all the nodes have to do is check that the person who signed the transaction has the corresponding public key. Once the system processes the transaction, only the owner of the corresponding private key can access the funds. Each account only has a single private key, meaning no other signature can unlock the funds at that address.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does a blockchain transaction work?\", \"ans\": \"First, a user initiates a transaction using a wallet or application, specifying the amount and recipient's address. Then, the transaction is signed with the sender's private key to ensure authenticity. The signed transaction is then broadcast to the blockchain network. The nodes receive the transaction and verify its format and validity. Valid transactions are stored in a temporary pool (mempool) until they are included in a block. Later, miners compete to group transactions into a new block, solve a cryptographic puzzle to validate the block, and add it to the blockchain. The network reaches consensus on the validity of the new block, adding it to the chain. Finally, the transaction is permanently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring immutability.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How to create a transaction?\", \"ans\": \"Before a blockchain transaction actually becomes a transaction, it starts life as the “intent” in a crypto wallet. This is essentially like an electronic proposal, and it will show you the details of a proposed transaction before you agree to it. For example, if you were initiating a transaction to send BTC to a friend, it would contain the Bitcoin wallet sender’s address (your public key), the destination address (wherever you’re sending funds), the subject of the transfer (the amount of BTC you want to send) and any other conditions.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How to sign the transaction?\", \"ans\": \"When you approve a transaction, you sign it with your private key. This proves that you own the account you intend to send money from and agree with the conditions of the transfer. This signed transaction also contains the information for where the assets should move—a specific public address. That allows the recipient to access the funds with their associated private key later.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Hows to distribute to the nodes after signing a transaction\", \"ans\": \"Within each node, the transaction enters the mempool. This is like a waiting room for transactions, but it’s important to note that there’s not a single mempool, there is one for each node. This means the nodes may validate transactions in a different order in this phase. Plus, some mempools are completely private. Since anyone can be a block creator, it actually means you can validate your own transactions and include them in a block. This means that some block creators will make their mempool private, only processing transactions from themselves and their associates.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How to verify in the mempool?\", \"ans\": \"It’s within the mempool that a node categorizes a transaction into one of two different statuses: queued or pending. Queued transactions are yet to be validated. To validate your transaction, nodes use your public key (which was included in the transaction) to check if your account has the digital assets you want to move. It also checks the validity of your signature. If everything is fine, the node validates the transaction and passes it on to the next node. Then the process continues.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the block creators?\", \"ans\": \"Well, most blockchains have a set of special nodes that can add new blocks to the chain. If you’ve ever wondered why we pay gas fees; here’s your answer: They compensate for the financial burden of creating a block.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the block creators on pow networks?\", \"ans\": \"On proof-of-work networks, like Bitcoin, those are miners, and these participants create new blocks by solving complex mathematical problems, which requires specialized equipment and a lot of energy.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the block creators on pos networks?\", \"ans\": \"On a proof-of-stake blockchain these block creators are named validators. Instead of racing to solve a complex mathematical problem, validators must lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in order to create a block. In this system, the creator of the block is chosen using either a voting mechanism, or simply by which validator has the most “stake”, i.e. coins locked up in the system.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is broadcasting and verification?\", \"ans\": \"The miner or validator node will broadcast the transaction to the network. This means all of the nodes will receive the information of the proposed block and verify its details.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Exemplify broadcasting and verification.\", \"ans\": \"For example, on a proof-of-work network, the block creator must find the correct solution to an incredibly complex computational problem. Only the quickest accurate block creator will get to propose the block. But following that, all of the other nodes will also solve the problem too–essentially checking that the proposed solution is correct. Plus, they will check all of the transaction details, verifying the sender has the funds they want to send, and the transaction fits the network’s underlying rules, also known as its consensus mechanism. These rules are the same in all network nodes scattered across the planet – meaning they will all come to the same conclusion for each block.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How to reach consensus?\", \"ans\": \"Consensus is reached when the majority of nodes reach the same conclusion: If the proposed block is valid, the nodes agree to add it to the ledger. So if you were sending cryptocurrency to a friend, the copy of the blockchain in each node would update to remove the funds from your account and add them into your friend’s. At this point, the transaction is finalized and the block creator receives the block reward.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do blockchains solve discrepancies in the chain?\", \"ans\": \"Unlike in the mempool, nodes must all receive validated blocks in the same order. Once the transaction is included in a block, it becomes an immutable part of the blockchain’s history. That’s because each block’s hash relies on the subsequent and previous blocks. This means, if a transaction is altered, it will undermine the security of the whole network. Essentially, the nodes can identify bad transactions as a single mistake will affect the validation of subsequent blocks.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do blockchains protect us from our own mistakes?\", \"ans\": \"Well, some nodes might be slower or faster to send around information than others. To help curb any discrepancies, many networks also have in-built rules. For example, on the Bitcoin network, the version of the chain with the longest valid chain of transactions is the “true copy”. This is because Bitcoin prioritizes the version of the chain which the most work already completed. This guarantees all nodes update to the most recent chain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do blockchain transactions work? Explain by using the bus station analogy\", \"ans\": \"The block size is like the bus and the ticket officer is your consensus mechanism.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What do you mean? Why is the block size like the bus?\", \"ans\": \"Imagine a bus station. Each bus represents a block that is going to be included on the blockchain and each person at the station represents a blockchain transaction waiting to be processed. Each bus can only hold a certain number of people, but depending on the sizes and needs of the people, that number can vary from bus to bus. Some people are smaller than others, and therefore take up less space on the bus. Some people are richer than others, and more willing to pay for a first class ticket- just to board before the rest. Blockchain transactions are similar. Some contain lots of information, and some contain less. However, there’s only a limited amount of space in a block. Then, just like our first class passengers, some participants are willing to pay a higher fee to slip their transaction in first.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What do you mean? How does the ticket officer corresponds to the consensus mechanism?\", \"ans\": \"Just like a bus station’s ticket officer will check all of the passengers have the correct tickets for the bus, the consensus mechanism of a blockchain will allow the nodes to verify if a transaction is valid. Using this information, they send each person to the waiting area. Once the passengers are ready to depart, or our transactions are ready to be included in a block, it’s time to broadcast them. For this, we rely on a block creator (or a bus driver in this analogy). For doing this work, the bus driver receives payment, just like our block creator receives rewards for their work. However, this leads the bus driver, or our block creators, to prioritize the transactions with the highest fees. Simply, their rewards are entirely dependent on how much the passengers (or transactors) are willing to pay. Unfortunately, this has a knock-on effect. During times of high network congestion, this can skyrocket network fees. To explain, if the network is busy, you’re fighting to pay a higher fee than other transactors. Essentially if there are only a few buses, and the bus drivers get paid by the passengers, those willing to pay the most go first. And that’s essentially how block creators handle blockchain transactions too.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are crypto nodes and how do they work?\", \"ans\": \"Public blockchains use a decentralized infrastructure that relies on a network of computers called nodes, rather than centralized servers like the internet. Crypto nodes maintain the latest record of blockchain networks and consistently verify and approve new transactions. They also ensure that everyone follows the rules set forth by the network. There are many types of nodes with differing use-cases, such as miner and validator nodes which create and propose new blocks.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is a crypto node?\", \"ans\": \"A crypto node is a single computer that can interact with and is part of, a blockchain network. On most blockchains, each node is a single and separate computer which stores all of the information on the blockchain, also known as a distributed ledger. Since every node has a copy of the same information, they can verify each other. This allows the nodes to verify and record new transactions and broadcast them to the network without the help of a central entity.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why is it that the greater the amount of crypto nodes, the harder it is to cheat the entire system\", \"ans\": \"That’s because tampering with a blockchain will—more often than not—require a bad actor to control over 51% of the nodes. This becomes practically impossible on popular networks, simply due to the sheer number of nodes you would have to control.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is a crypto node for?\", \"ans\": \"Firstly, crypto nodes store the data necessary for a blockchain to operate. This can include the entire distributed ledger and all of its transactions. The other important job crypto nodes have is communicating with each other. This is integral to keep the nodes in consensus, i.e. making sure every node has the same copy of the chain. It’s basically the method the nodes use to synchronize, making sure the blockchain is the same for everyone. Beyond that, some crypto nodes also have other jobs, such as verifying blockchain transactions and rejecting those that don’t fit the mold. Plus they can also offer a copy of the blockchain to any new node that wishes to join the network.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Crypto nodes VS Miners VS Validator. What's the difference?\", \"ans\": \"Very often, the words ‘nodes’ and ‘miners’ are used interchangeably in crypto, but they’re not the same thing. So, let’s clarify that confusing point now. A miner is a dedicated computer system that can add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. To mine new coins or validate transactions, this miner must solve the puzzle–a complex mathematical computation–which requires a considerable amount of energy. This crypto mining mechanic is what keeps a proof-of-work blockchain secure. Simply, bitcoin mining is too costly to consider trying to cheat the system. This is where it may be confusing to some, as each miner is a node. However, not every node is a miner. For example, anyone can run a crypto node to help the Bitcoin consensus run without mining a single coin. Plus, beyond those distinctions, there are also differences across different types of networks too. For example, on proof-of-stake networks, nodes are operated by validators instead of miners. But even on proof-of-stake networks you can also set up your own node without validating transactions. Thus nodes and validators are not synonymous either.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How many types of crypto nodes are there\", \"ans\": \"There are 2 main types of nodes: Full Nodes and Light Nodes. Each of these exists for separate reasons and has different capabilities.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is a full node?\", \"ans\": \"Put simply, a full node stores a full copy of the network’s digital ledger. These types of crypto nodes  build the foundations for most blockchains; storing the history of the chain and communicating with other full nodes. These are also the nodes responsible for providing a copy of the chain to new nodes: They really are the backbone of a network, which is why most blockchains will have these types of nodes.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are miner nodes?\", \"ans\": \"Miner nodes are the participants responsible for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain on a proof-of-work blockchain. Mining requires a lot of computational power to solve complex puzzles. However, they also receive cryptocurrency rewards in return for their work.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are validator nodes?\", \"ans\": \"Validator nodes are similar to miner nodes, but on a proof-of-stake network instead: They also validate transactions and create blocks. However, they don’t have to solve complex computational puzzles, they are chosen in relation to the amount of funds they lock in the system. Like miners though, they also receive rewards for creating blocks.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are light nodes?\", \"ans\": \"SPV clients, also called light nodes, are a little different. Firstly, these types of nodes do not store the entire blockchain like their heavyweight counterparts. Instead, they just download ‘block headers’. Without getting too technical, it means they don’t require as much storage capacity. Instead, these crypto nodes’ only task is to verify transactions in the blockchain using simplified payment verification (SPV). It’s important to note that not all blockchains use these types of nodes. Mainly, they are popular in blockchains that have limited storage space per block, such as Bitcoin.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do crypto nodes distribute the signed transaction?\", \"ans\": \"When you sign a transaction, the details are sent to a set of nodes.  The first set of nodes passes it onto the other nodes, who then pass it on to the next level of nodes. They do this until the transaction is included in a block or discarded.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do nodes verify transactions in the mempool?\", \"ans\": \"As the transaction is distributed, it enters a mempool in each node. Initially, it has a queued status. But from there, the nodes must validate the transaction. Once the majority of nodes validate that the transaction is valid, it moves to a pending status. This means that the transaction is ready to be added to the chain. Conversely, if the majority of nodes decide a transaction is not valid, it will be discarded.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do nodes add transactionis to blocks and broadcast them to the network?\", \"ans\": \"Once the transaction moves to a pending status, miner or validator nodes are able to add the block to the network. At the point a miner or validator wins the block and adds it to the chain, the transaction becomes immutable. To explain, making any alteration to the transaction would require the majority of nodes’ approval, which could be thousands of nodes in more popular blockchains. This simple mechanism keeps the chain secure.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the incentives and deterrents for nodes in ensuring good behavior?\", \"ans\": \"At this point, it’s important to note that some nodes are responsible for adding blocks to the network, which will usually earn them cryptocurrency rewards. On a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin, this requires a large amount of computational power in order to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle. This means that miners have an incentive to add valid blocks to the chain, but they also have a deterrent from behaving dishonorably—simply the energy cost of mining wouldn’t be profitable without the block rewards. On a proof-of-stake blockchain, participating nodes also receive block rewards, but as a deterrent for bad behavior, these chains have a different method. To explain, validators must lock up a significant amount of their funds as collateral. Then if they behave honorably, they receive more rewards. If they behave maliciously, their collateral—also called a stake—is slashed. This mechanism ensures that nodes behave as they should, even without an ongoing energy cost and expensive equipment.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why are crypto nodes so important?\", \"ans\": \"Crypto nodes are integral to the security of blockchain systems. When trying to execute tasks in a decentralized manner, the only option is a peer-to-peer system, and the only way to manage one effectively is via a blockchain network. Nodes allow blockchains to validate transactions in a fair way—and without a centralized entity taking a cut. Plus, the more participants there are operating nodes, the harder it is for bad actors to collude or take control of the network. They ensure that the users and miners are playing by the rules, with both features making the network more decentralized and secure.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Summarize why are crypto nodes influential?\", \"ans\": \"Nodes are the basis of blockchain systems; without them, there would be no blockchain storage in the first place. Together, nodes provide the whole infrastructure for a blockchain network—which is why understanding them is so important.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the primary purpose of consensus protocols in blockchain?\", \"ans\": \"To ensure all network participants agree on the validity of transactions and maintain a single, tamper-proof version of the truth without central authority.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does Proof of Work (PoW) secure blockchain networks?\", \"ans\": \"Miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions. Success requires massive computational power, making attacks economically unfeasible.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why is Proof of Stake (PoS) considered energy-efficient?\", \"ans\": \"It replaces computational puzzles with validators who \"stake\" cryptocurrency as collateral, eliminating energy-intensive mining hardware.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What role do nodes play in consensus mechanisms?\", \"ans\": \"Nodes independently verify transactions and blocks, ensuring no single entity controls the network.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) handle malicious actors?\", \"ans\": \"It requires nodes to communicate and agree on transaction validity, tolerating up to 1/3 of participants acting maliciously.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is a 51% attack?\", \"ans\": \"A \"51% attack\" refers to a scenario where an attacker gains control of more than 50% of the computing power (hash rate) on a blockchain network, allowing them to manipulate transactions, reverse previous transactions (\"double-spending\"), and potentially censor new transactions, essentially giving them control over the network's blockchain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What's the impact of a 51% attack\", \"ans\": \"A successful 51% attack can significantly undermine the security of a blockchain network by allowing attackers to manipulate transactions, disrupt the network, and potentially steal funds.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why is decentralization critical for consensus security\", \"ans\": \"Decentralization is crucial for consensus security because it disperses power and responsibility among many participants, making it significantly harder for any single entity or group to gain control or manipulate the network. This prevents collusion, reduces the risk of single points of failure, and enhances the overall security of the consensus mechanism.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does decentralized system distribute power\", \"ans\": \"Instead of relying on a single authority, decentralized systems distribute power and decision-making across a network of participants. This prevents any one entity from controlling the consensus process or manipulating the network's state.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does decentralized system reduce risk of collusion?\", \"ans\": \"Decentralization makes it much more difficult for malicious actors to collude and gain control of the network. The larger the number of participants, the harder it is for attackers to coordinate their efforts.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does decentralized system enhance security?\", \"ans\": \"By distributing power and responsibility, decentralized systems are more resilient to attacks, including 51% attacks, where a single entity could potentially control a majority of the network.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does decentralized system enable trustless collaboration?\", \"ans\": \"Decentralized consensus mechanisms enable trustless collaboration among participants who may not know or trust each other. This is achieved by requiring agreement among a majority of participants for any change to the network's state.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does decentralized system resist to censorship\", \"ans\": \"Decentralized systems are less susceptible to censorship and manipulation, as decisions are made collectively rather than by a single authority. This fosters a more transparent and democratic system.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does Nakamoto Consensus (Bitcoin’s model) resolve conflicts?\", \"ans\": \"Nakamoto Consensus, the consensus mechanism used in Bitcoin, resolves conflicts arising from temporary forks in the blockchain by having nodes adopt the longest valid chain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What would happen to the forks in a decentralized network\", \"ans\": \"In a decentralized network like Bitcoin, multiple miners might independently find valid solutions to the Proof-of-Work puzzle around the same time. This can lead to temporary forks, where the blockchain temporarily splits into two or more branches, each with a different set of blocks and transaction history. A conflict arises because the network needs to agree on a single, canonical version of the blockchain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the longest chain rule?\", \"ans\": \"Nakamoto Consensus dictates that nodes should always follow the longest chain, meaning the chain with the most cumulative computational work behind it, as determined by the Proof-of-Work.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why is the longest chain rule critical?\", \"ans\": \"The longest chain rule is crucial for resolving conflicts and ensuring that the network converges on a single, agreed-upon version of the blockchain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How exactly does Nakamoto Consensus resolves conflicts\", \"ans\": \"When a fork occurs, nodes may receive blocks from different branches. Nodes evaluate the length of each chain by calculating the cumulative Proof-of-Work associated with it. The chain with the most accumulated work is considered the longest and is chosen as the canonical chain. Blocks and transactions from shorter chains are discarded, and transactions are returned to the mempool to be included in future blocks.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why would nakamoto consensus work effectively in resolving conflicts\", \"ans\": \"The Proof-of-Work mechanism makes it computationally expensive to create new blocks, ensuring that the longest chain is likely built by the majority of honest miners, who are economically incentivized to follow the rules. While not providing absolute certainty, the longest chain rule offers probabilistic finality, meaning that the probability of a block being part of the canonical chain increases as more blocks are added on top of it. The rule doesn't require a central authority to decide which chain is valid, allowing the network to converge on a consensus in a decentralized manner.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Sum up why would nakamoto consensus work effectively in resolving conflicts\", \"ans\": \"In summary, the longest chain rule in Nakamoto Consensus effectively resolves conflicts by ensuring that the network, through the cumulative Proof-of-Work, converges on a single, consistent version of the blockchain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is \"finality\" in consensus protocols?\", \"ans\": \"\"Finality\" in consensus protocols refers to the point at which a transaction is considered permanently confirmed and cannot be reversed or changed, effectively becoming an immutable part of the blockchain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the irreversibility about finality\", \"ans\": \"Once a transaction reaches finality, it is considered settled and cannot be undone.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the consensus mechanism about finality\", \"ans\": \"Different consensus protocols determine how finality is achieved, with some offering faster finality times than others.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the economic incentives about finality\", \"ans\": \"In many consensus protocols, like Proof-of-Stake (PoS), economic incentives discourage validators from attempting to reverse transactions, as they risk losing their stake.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the confirmation time about finality\", \"ans\": \"The time it takes for a transaction to reach finality can vary depending on the consensus protocol and network conditions.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Examplify finality\", \"ans\": \"Imagine a transaction on the Bitcoin network. It becomes final after six blocks have been added on top of the block containing the transaction, ensuring that it is highly unlikely to be reversed.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do consensus protocols prevent double-spending?\", \"ans\": \"Consensus protocols prevent double-spending by ensuring that all nodes on the network agree on the validity and order of transactions before a block is added to the blockchain, effectively preventing a user from spending the same digital currency twice.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the consensus mechanism?\", \"ans\": \"It is a set of rules that govern how nodes on a blockchain network agree on the validity of transactions. \"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is transaction validation?\", \"ans\": \"Before a transaction is added to a block, it must be verified by multiple nodes to ensure it is not a double-spend attempt.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the majority role regarding consensus protocols\", \"ans\": \"Most consensus protocols require a majority of nodes to agree on a transaction's validity before it is added to the blockchain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is blockchain immutability\", \"ans\": \"Once a transaction is added to a block, it is very difficult to alter because of the consensus mechanism and the chain of previous blocks.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What's an example of a consensus protocol\", \"ans\": \"In the Proof of Work mechanism, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The miner who solves the puzzle first gets to add the next block to the blockchain, and their version of the transaction history is considered valid. Since multiple miners are competing, it is very difficult for a malicious actor to control a majority of the network and attempt a double-spending attack.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the features of PoS?\", \"ans\": \"In PoS, validators are chosen based on the amount of the blockchain's cryptocurrency they hold and \"stake\". Potentially speaking, PoS can be more decentralized, but may lead to slower transaction processing compared to DPoS. Lastly, PoS is more energy efficient compared to Proof of Work (PoW).\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the features of DPos?\", \"ans\": \"Delegated Proof of Stake as DPoS introduces a voting system where token holders elect delegates to validate transactions and produce blocks. DPoS can achieve faster transaction processing, but it may lead to a more centralized network if a few delegates become dominant. DPoS allows token holders to vote for delegates and potentially remove them if they are not performing well.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What distinguishes DPoS from PoS?\", \"ans\": \"DPoS builds upon PoS by adding delegation, where token holders vote for transaction validators. This aims for a balance between efficiency, scalability, and democratic governance. There is a potential trade-off between speed and decentralization when comparing DPoS to PoS.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why is Sybil resistance essential?\", \"ans\": \"Sybil resistance is crucial in distributed systems because it prevents attackers from creating fake identities to gain undue influence and disrupt the system's integrity. This is achieved by making it difficult for attackers to create and manage numerous distinct identities, thus limiting their ability to manipulate consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Sybil attacks can undermine the fairness and security of systems by giving attackers disproportionate voting power or control over network resources.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does Sybil resistence maintains system integrity\", \"ans\": \"Sybil resistance ensures that the network's consensus mechanism accurately reflects the real participants and their legitimate interests, preventing manipulation and skewing of the system's behavior.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does Sybil resistence prevents disproportionate influence\", \"ans\": \"By making it difficult to create fake identities, Sybil resistance prevents attackers from gaining excessive control over network resources or voting power, which could be used to disrupt the system or favor specific agendas.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does Sybil resistence protects against attacks\", \"ans\": \"Sybil resistance measures help prevent attackers from exploiting the system's reliance on distributed consensus to undermine its security and fairness.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does Sybil resistence ensures fiar participation\", \"ans\": \"Sybil resistance fosters a fair and equitable environment where legitimate participants are not disadvantaged by the actions of malicious actors attempting to create fake identities to control the network.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do consensus protocols achieve scalability?\", \"ans\": \"Consensus protocols achieve scalability through various optimizations and solutions. These include optimizing block size, enhancing validation speed (e.g., using Proof-of-Stake), and leveraging Layer-2 solutions like rollups. Additionally, techniques like sharding can further improve scalability by dividing the blockchain into smaller, parallelizable shards.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do consensus protocols optimize block size?\", \"ans\": \"Increasing the size of blocks allows for more transactions to be included in each block, thereby increasing the overall transaction throughput.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do consensus protocols enhance validation speed?\", \"ans\": \"Using consensus protocols like Proof-of-Stake (PoS) can significantly speed up the validation process compared to Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoS relies on validators who stake their own cryptocurrency to participate in the consensus process, making it more efficient and less resource-intensive.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is layer-2 solutions\", \"ans\": \"Rollups are Layer-2 scaling solutions that process transactions off-chain and then submit a compact representation of these transactions to the main chain for consensus. This off-chain processing allows for significantly increased transaction throughput without overloading the main chain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is sharding\", \"ans\": \"Sharding involves dividing the blockchain into smaller, independent segments called shards. Each shard can process its own transactions and smart contracts, potentially improving transaction speed and reducing the load on individual nodes.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the \"nothing at stake\" problem in PoS?\", \"ans\": \"The \"nothing at stake\" problem is a potential vulnerability in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms where validators have little to no disincentive to validate and support multiple, potentially conflicting, versions of a blockchain (known as forks).\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why would the nothing at stake problem incentive supports of all fokes\", \"ans\": \"In PoS, validators are rewarded for validating blocks, and unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW), validating doesn't require significant computational resources.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why would the nothing at stake problem invalidate multiple chains\", \"ans\": \"Validators can validate blocks on multiple forks simultaneously, increasing their chances of earning rewards, regardless of which fork ultimately becomes the \"winning\" or accepted chain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why would the nothing at stake problem threaten consensus\", \"ans\": \"This behavior can undermine consensus, as it becomes harder for the network to agree on a single, valid version of the blockchain.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why would the nothing at stake problem troubles cause double-spending\", \"ans\": \"The lack of disincentive could make it easier for malicious actors to attempt double-spending attacks by creating a fork and validating transactions on it.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Hows does the nothing at stake problem differ from pow\", \"ans\": \"In PoW, miners expend significant computational resources (electricity, hardware) to mine blocks. Additionally, if a miner splits their resources to mine on multiple forks, they reduce their chances of finding the next block on any chain, creating an opportunity cost. \"},\n        {\"que\": \"How PoS systems address the nothing at stake problem\", \"ans\": \"PoS protocols often implement \"slashing,\" a mechanism that penalizes validators for dishonest behavior, such as validating conflicting blocks, by destroying a portion or all of their stake. Slashing provides an economic disincentive for validators to support multiple forks, thereby strengthening the network's ability to reach consensus and prevent double-spending.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do economic incentives secure consensus?\", \"ans\": \"Economic incentives, like rewards for honest validation and penalties for dishonesty, are crucial for securing consensus in a decentralized system.

This financial incentive motivates them to participate in the network and contribute to its stability.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What are the staking rewards\", \"ans\": \"In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, participants who stake their cryptocurrency to validate transactions are rewarded for their contribution. This reward is a form of passive income and encourages active participation in network operations.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is a slashing penalty\", \"ans\": \"If a validator (or miner) engages in malicious behavior, such as double-spending or attempting to alter the blockchain, they may face a slashing penalty. This penalty involves the loss of some or all of their staked cryptocurrency, serving as a deterrent against dishonest actions.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is deterrent penality for inactivity\", \"ans\": \"Validators may also face penalties for prolonged inactivity or failing to validate transactions correctly. This helps maintain network security and reliability by ensuring that validators are actively participating and contributing to the consensus process.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do economic incentives encourage honest validation\", \"ans\": \"The rewards and penalties create a system where it's more economically beneficial for participants to act honestly and contribute to the network's integrity.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does economic incentives deter malicious behavior\", \"ans\": \"The risk of slashing and other penalties acts as a powerful deterrent against attempts to compromise the blockchain or manipulate the network.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does economic incentives ensure network security\", \"ans\": \"By incentivizing honest behavior and deterring malicious activity, economic incentives contribute to the overall security and stability of the blockchain network.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does economic incentives promote decentralization\", \"ans\": \"In PoS systems, the use of staking and rewards can encourage greater decentralization by allowing more participants to contribute to the network's security.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)?\", \"ans\": \"Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a consensus algorithm designed to work efficiently in asynchronous distributed systems, specifically optimized to have low latency.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)\", \"ans\": \"PBFT is a specific type of BFT algorithm. BFT algorithms, in general, aim to enable a distributed system to reach consensus even when some nodes may fail or behave maliciously (known as Byzantine faults).\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the practicality of PBFT\", \"ans\": \"PBFT is an optimization of the original BFT algorithm, making it more practical for real-world systems by reducing its complexity and improving efficiency.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does PBFT work\", \"ans\": \"Nodes are ordered with one primary node (leader) and backup nodes (replicas). The primary node proposes a block of transactions. The consensus process involves three phases: Pre-prepare, the primary node broadcasts a proposed block; prepare, nodes validate the proposal and broadcast a prepare message; commit, nodes commit to the block after receiving enough prepare messages.

Mnemonic phrases, on the other hand, are composed of a series of common words, making them significantly easier to write down, back up, and restore. Thus, using words instead of random characters reduces the likelihood of human error during backup and recovery processes.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why are 12/24 words used for generating infinite keys\", \"ans\": \"A mnemonic phrase acts as a seed, a starting point from which an infinite number of private keys can be derived using deterministic algorithms. This method is utilized in Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, allowing users to manage multiple accounts and cryptocurrencies with a single seed phrase. Users can backup and restore access to their entire wallet and all associated addresses with just the mnemonic phrase, simplifying the management of multiple private keys.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Summarize the benefits of using 12/24 words instead of a private key\", \"ans\": \"In essence, the mnemonic phrase acts as a master key to your cryptocurrency wallet. It's easier for humans to handle and allows for generating an unlimited number of private keys, making it a convenient and secure way to manage your crypto assets.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Where should you store an SRP?\", \"ans\": \"An SRP (Secret Recovery Phrase) should be stored offline on physical, durable materials like metal backups, such as those provided by BillFODL. Avoid storing it digitally or in the cloud, as these are vulnerable to various cyber threats.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do you store an srp using durable materials\", \"ans\": \"Metal plates, like those offered by BillFODL, are preferred because they are resistant to fire, water, and other damage that could compromise digital storage.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is BillFODL?\", \"ans\": \"BillFODL is a physical storage solution designed specifically for storing seed phrases and SRPs securely.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does an SRP restore a wallet?\", \"ans\": \"A Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP), or seed phrase, is a collection of words used to restore a cryptocurrency wallet. When you input these words in the correct order, they recreate the master seed and all derived keys, effectively restoring the wallet's functionality and access to your funds.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How to restore the wallet using SRP\", \"ans\": \"When you enter the SRP into a new wallet, the wallet uses the words to regenerate the master seed and then derive all the necessary keys. This allows you to access your funds and transactions as if you were using the original wallet.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Does the order matter in restoring the wallet?\", \"ans\": \"The order of the words in the SRP is extremely important. Even a single word out of place can prevent successful restoration.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why split an SRP?\", \"ans\": \"Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS), used in Shamir backup and services like Ledger Recover, splits a secret (like a Secret Recovery Phrase or private key) into multiple parts (shares or shards) to enhance security and redundancy. By distributing these shares, you avoid having a single point of failure, meaning if one share is lost or compromised, your assets remain safe. You can choose a threshold, requiring a certain number of shares (e.g., 2 out of 3) to reconstruct the original secret.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"So why split an SRP, specifically out of redundancy and risk concerns\", \"ans\": \"With a single secret phrase or private key, if you lose or forget it, you lose access to your funds. Shamir backup splits the secret into multiple parts, making it less vulnerable to loss or compromise of a single backup.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"So why split an SRP especially for storage problems\", \"ans\": \"You can distribute the shares among different locations (e.g., home, trusted family member, secure location) to further mitigate the risk of loss or theft in a single location.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Why split an SRP regarding the threshold for rebuilding\", \"ans\": \"You can define a threshold, meaning a specific number of shares needed to reconstruct the secret. This offers flexibility; if one share is lost, you can still recover your assets by combining the remaining shares.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What's an example of Shamir Backup and Ledger Recover\", \"ans\": \"Ledger Recover uses a variation of SSS to split your Secret Recovery Phrase into shares, and it utilizes a 2-of-3 scheme, meaning at least two shares are required to reconstruct the original Secret Recovery Phrase. This makes the backup resilient to the loss of one provider.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How do SRPs enhance portability?\", \"ans\": \"Secret Recovery Phrases (SRPs) enhance portability by allowing compatible wallets to restore keys and access associated funds on any device that supports the same SRP standard. This means that if you have a Ledger Nano X and a MetaMask browser extension, for example, you can restore your MetaMask wallet on a different device or even after reinstalling MetaMask by using your Ledger's SRP.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What's the wallet compatibility when it comes to SRP\", \"ans\": \"Many wallets, like Ledger hardware wallets and MetaMask, are designed to accept SRPs for restoration. This compatibility ensures that you can use your SRP to recover your wallet even if you lose your primary device or your primary wallet is compromised.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Can I restore my keys anywhere with srps\", \"ans\": \"By entering your SRP into a compatible wallet on a new device, you effectively restore your private keys and regain control over your associated accounts. This process is the same regardless of whether you are using a different computer, mobile device, or even a different hardware wallet.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Can you change an SRP?\", \"ans\": \"Yes, it's generally not possible to directly change a Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP). Instead, you can create a new wallet with a new SRP and transfer your funds to the new wallet. This is the standard process for \"rotating\" your SRP to improve security or if you suspect your current SRP might have been compromised.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What's the immutability about in SRP\", \"ans\": \"Once the SRP is generated, it's generally considered immutable. You cannot edit or modify it. It's like a master key to your crypto assets.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What's the meaning of 'New Wallet, New SRP'\", \"ans\": \"To change your SRP, you need to create a new wallet and generate a new SRP. This new wallet will have its own set of private keys derived from the new SRP.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How to transfer funds with SRP\", \"ans\": \"You can then move your funds from your old wallet (with the old SRP) to your new wallet (with the new SRP) by sending transactions to the new wallet's address.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"Is changing an SRP a safe action?\", \"ans\": \"Rotating your SRP is a security best practice. It's advisable to do so if you suspect your old SRP might have been compromised or if you want to increase the security of your crypto assets.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"New Wallet, New SRP\", \"ans\": \"Starting with a new digital wallet and a new Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) is a smart way to enhance security and potentially isolate your assets. This approach allows you to manage multiple accounts or wallets with different SRPs, offering an extra layer of protection in case one SRP is compromised. You can use digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay to store credit/debit cards.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How to securely store your new SRP\", \"ans\": \"It is very important to keep your new SRP in a safe and secure place, separate from your old SRP(s). Don't rely on cloud storage for your SRP, as this could compromise your security. Consider writing down your SRP in a physical location, such as a locked safe, or on a piece of paper kept in a secure location.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How to transfer or move assets from the old wallet to the new one\", \"ans\": \"If you have assets in an existing wallet, you may need to transfer them to your new wallet. The process of transferring assets depends on the specific wallet and the assets you're transferring.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What’s the relationship between SRP and private keys?\", \"ans\": \"The relationship between the SRP (Secure Remote Password) protocol and private keys is that the SRP is a method for generating a shared secret key, which can then be used as a basis for deriving individual private keys. The SRP itself is not a private key; it's a protocol that facilitates secure key exchange and authentication.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is the srp protocol\", \"ans\": \"The SRP protocol is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties (a client and a server) to securely share a secret key without transmitting the user's password in plain text.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is an example of SRP protocol in relation to private keys\", \"ans\": \"In a cryptocurrency wallet, the SRP protocol might be used to generate a shared secret key, which is then used to derive the private key for a specific address within the wallet.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is phishing in crypto?\", \"ans\": \"In the crypto world, phishing is a cyberattack where scammers trick users into revealing sensitive information, like private keys or recovery phrases, through fake websites or emails.
