Bitcoin and Ethereum exemplify networks facilitating decentralized transactions.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does blockchain ensure authentication and verification?\", \"ans\": \"Blockchain uses cryptographic techniques to verify transaction authenticity, ensuring ownership over digital assets and accounts. Applications extend beyond financial transactions, including on-chain certificates and access control for decentralized platforms. Token-gated systems use blockchain verification to restrict entry to specific users.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does a blockchain transaction stay secure?\", \"ans\": \"Blockchain security is maintained through cryptographic hashing, public-key encryption, and consensus mechanisms like PoW and PoS. Transactions are immutable once recorded on the blockchain, preventing unauthorized modifications. This decentralized approach ensures transparency and security.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"What is public key cryptography?\", \"ans\": \"Public key cryptography secures blockchain transactions using a pair of cryptographic keys: a private key for signing and a public key for verification. The private key grants full control over an account, while the public key allows others to send assets to that account securely. Blockchain addresses are derived from hashed versions of public keys, ensuring authenticity while maintaining privacy.\"},\n        {\"que\": \"How does a blockchain transaction work?\", \"ans\": \"A blockchain transaction begins when a user initiates it via a wallet, specifying the amount and recipient's address.
