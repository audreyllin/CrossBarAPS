        "        {\"que\": \"What are PoS advantages?\", \"ans\": \"Lower energy costs, faster transactions, and validator accountability via staking. Malicious actors lose staked funds, enhancing security. It supports scalability solutions like sharding, enabling networks like Ethereum to process thousands of transactions per second.\"},\n",
        "        {\"que\": \"What is PoS?\", \"ans\": \"Proof of Stake replaces mining with validators who stake tokens to propose/blocks.

        "        {\"que\": \"What are PoW drawbacks?\", \"ans\": \"High energy consumption (Bitcoin uses ~130 TWh/year) and centralization risks due to specialized mining hardware (ASICs) and mining pools. These factors contradict Bitcoin's original decentralized vision and raise environmental concerns.\"},\n",
        "        {\"que\": \"How do crypto wallets secure assets?\", \"ans\": \"Wallets store private keys, which control blockchain access. Cold wallets (offline, e.g., Ledger) offer high security; hot wallets (online, e.g., MetaMask) prioritize convenience. Losing the private key or seed phrase results in irreversible fund loss, emphasizing self-custody responsibility.\"},\n",
        "        {\"que\": \"What is the double-spending problem?\", \"ans\": \"The risk of digital currency being spent twice, absent a central authority. Blockchain solves this by timestamping transactions and validating them via consensus. Once recorded, transactions are irreversible, preventing duplication. PoW and PoS mechanisms further secure the ledger against such attacks.\"},\n",
        "        {\"que\": \"What are altcoins?\", \"ans\": \"Cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, such as Litecoin (LTC) or Ethereum (ETH). Some are Bitcoin forks with minor tweaks, while others, like Ethereum, introduce smart contracts or unique features. They often serve niche roles, like privacy (Monero) or scalability (Solana), but many are speculative investments.\"},\n",
        "        {\"que\": \"How does blockchain technology work?\", \"ans\": \"Transactions are broadcast to a network of nodes, validated via consensus (e.g., mining in PoW), and grouped into blocks. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the prior block, ensuring tamper resistance. Once validated, blocks are added permanently to the chain, visible to all participants. This decentralization prevents single points of failure or control.\"},\n",
        "        {\"que\": \"What is Blockchain?\", \"ans\": \"A decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each transaction is grouped into a block, cryptographically linked to the previous one, creating an immutable chain. It relies on consensus mechanisms (e.g., PoW, PoS) for validation, eliminating the need for central authority. Bitcoin pioneered its use, but applications now span finance, supply chain, and more.\"}\n",
