1. Frontend Development
* Design and build a responsive, intuitive UI for:
   * Uploading documents, images, and videos
   * Typing and submitting prompts
   * Previewing and downloading AI-generated outputs (text, slides, images, videos)
* Support multiple media types:
   * Rich text editors for prompt input
   * File upload components with drag-and-drop
   * Media preview components (PDF, PPTX, MP4, etc.)
2. Backend Infrastructure
* Create secure APIs to:
   * Accept user inputs and files
   * Route requests to internal AI agents (via internal endpoints or message queues)
   * Return generated content for preview/download
* Handle file storage:
   * Organize uploads by user/session
   * Store generated outputs for retrieval
* Implement versioning for documents and outputs
3. Middleware / Proxy Layer
* Avoid CORS issues by:
   * Acting as a proxy between frontend and internal AI services
   * Ensuring all AI calls are made server-side
* Format prompts before sending to AI:
   * Expand user input into structured prompts (e.g., for slide decks, videos, memos)
   * Add metadata like media type, tone, or target audience
4. Integration with Internal AI
* Connect to internal AI endpoints (built by your coworkers):
   * Text generation (Phase 1)
   * Image generation (Phase 2)
   * Video generation (Phase 3)
* Support prompt templating:
   * Dynamically adjust prompt structure based on media type and user intent
5. Document Management
* Build a document ingestion interface:
   * Allow BD team to upload and tag documents (internal vs external)
   * Store metadata (version, source, type)
* Enable AI access to documents via:
   * Embedding pipelines (if needed)
   * Searchable indices or vector stores (if integrated)
6. Admin & Feedback Tools
* Create dashboards for:
   * BD team to review and edit AI outputs
   * Tracking prompt history and output versions
* Implement feedback capture:
   * Let users rate or comment on AI outputs
   * Store feedback for model fine-tuning or audits
