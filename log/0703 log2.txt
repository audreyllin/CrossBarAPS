🚨 High-Priority Backend & Server Tasks
* Ensure server deployment and stability on Render
   * Continuously monitor performance and connectivity.
   * Handle any failures or crashes proactively.
* Implement AI-driven file ingestion pipeline
   * Auto-sort PDF/PPT/DOC files using keyword analysis.
   * Enable summarization capabilities for slide decks and business presentations.
   * Output should be accurate, fast, and follow presentation conventions (title + subtitles + body).
* Support script/Kaggle code embedding
   * Test Kaggle or API-sourced scripts locally (e.g., via VS Code).
   * Once verified, embed into the platform with proper security and access control.
🧠 Frontend Development (AI Portal Interface)
“Text Extension” & “Media Transformation” Modules
* Create the base logic UI to:
   * Display full retrieved content, with options to shorten or summarize.
   * Convert into bullet points or keyword extracts.
   * Integrate translation tools.
   * Add terminology explanations and competitor comparisons from the SharePoint-linked resources.
Enhanced Interaction Design
* Add loading animations and friendly UI prompts like “Please wait…” to improve user flow.
* Embed rich content like AI-generated summaries, keyword highlights, and file previews.
“Static” Output: PPT, PDF, Posters
* Build UI to upload/import design references and apply them as presentation themes.
* Enable exporting to stylized formats, mimicking pitch-deck styles.
* Allow image/video embedding based on keyword-matched assets.
Stream (Video/Reels)
* Brainstorm + define core templates for video generation workflows.
* Integrate with tools like PixVerse or CapCut, and allow:
   * Content selection by keyword/theme.
   * Flexible durations.
   * Music, subtitles, transitions, and AI-generated visual content.
🎨 UI/UX and Web Design Customization
* Refactor header/footer components:
   * Reorder "News" and "Company"
   * Fix "Develop" → "Development" globally but carefully
* Make hero section fully visible/responsive at 1024–1440px widths.
* Rework font sizes using vw or em for titles and paragraphs.
* Improve button styles, hover effects, and accessibility contrast.
* Adjust layout for intuitive navigation and better mobile responsiveness.
🧑‍💻 AI Assistant Integration
* Build a persistent assistant overlay that:
   * Can expand to full-screen or collapse neatly.
   * Is static during animations.
   * Uses a more intuitive icon (suggested: robot head + speech bubble or glowing brain).
* Ensure assistant is embedded across all pages for a cohesive experience.
✅ Cross-Team Collaboration
* Coordinate with ChoCho to:
   * Set up Crossbar's media channels (TikTok, YouTube, etc.).
* Identify and ingest internal files + competitor docs into backend DB for comparative analysis modules.
